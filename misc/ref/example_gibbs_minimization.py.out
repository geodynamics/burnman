Example 1: The aluminosilicates
The and-sill-ky invariant can be found at 0.43 GPa and 809 K

Example 2: The olivine polymorphs
The pressure of the olivine polymorph invariant at 1400 K is 11.9 GPa
The molar Fe2SiO4 contents of coexisting ol, wad and rw
at this point are 0.15, 0.29 and 0.44

Example 3: Lower mantle phase relations in peridotite
Composition: {'Mg': 1.775, 'Si': 0.975, 'Fe': 0.2, 'O': 4.0, 'Al': 0.05}
At 22.0 GPa and 2000 K, ferropericlase contains 15.7 mole percent FeO
At 130.0 GPa and 2000 K, this has changed to 13.4 mole percent FeO
