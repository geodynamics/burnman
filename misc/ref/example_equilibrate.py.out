Example 1: The aluminosilicates
The and-sill-ky invariant can be found at 0.43 GPa and 809 K

Example 2: The olivine polymorphs
The pressure of the olivine polymorph invariant at 1673 K is 12.0 GPa
The molar Fe2SiO4 contents of coexisting ol, wad and rw
at this point are 0.24, 0.39 and 0.52

Example 3: Lower mantle phase relations in peridotite
Composition: {'Mg': 1.775, 'Si': 0.975, 'Fe': 0.2, 'O': 4.0, 'Al': 0.05}
At 22.0 GPa and 2000 K, ferropericlase contains 15.7 mole percent FeO
At 130.0 GPa and 2000 K, this has changed to 13.4 mole percent FeO

Example 4: Garnet immiscibility
At 0.0 GPa and 300 K, the pyrope-grossular immiscibility gap extends from 0.021 to 0.979 mole percent grossular
