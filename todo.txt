TODOLIST:

Post Texas Meeting Todos:

- Talk to CIG - do they want us? -- Timo
- Geotherm vs. Brown+Shankland for paper --Ian
- Make brentq more robust --Ian
- Why python? -- Timo
- Make comments up-to-date -- Cayman/everybody 
- Optimize pv example --Sanne
- Geotherm stuff in burnman paper --Ian
- EOS stuff in burnman paper --Ian/Cayman
- Explain 2nd/3rd order stuff in burnman paper --Ian
- Make figures pretty - Timo
- Bibliography -- Sanne/Cayman
- Write section about possibilities for extension/future plans -- Everyone


- warn if used eos and mineral eos are different
- input different averaging schemes (Voigt and Reuss as separate options, other schemes)
- clean up composition.py
- benchmark against Matas et al. 2007 Sanne
- implement option to evaluate K and G (instead of V_s, V_p, V_phi)?
- document examples (see example_composition.py)
- document classes and functions in burnman better, specify units!
- should we split up example_composition.py? Opinions? Timo: yes, try to teach creating of minerals separately. Cayman: I agree. Let's just do this Timo.
- order examples (figure out dependencies for that), see bottom of readme.txt
- write a manual (what needs to go in here? Nothing but the order of the examples?) Sanne: in the matlab package MSAT, I noticed their manual on the examples was made up out of blocks of text at the top of the examples. I'm not 100% sure yet how they did this. It seems usefull, when we update examples, that the manual changes consistently. 
- Test the forward problem further, make sure we don't make a mistake with Murakamis results (V_phi?, Sanne: V_phi is alarming different between slb and mgd)
- long term: setup inverse model runs, what makes sense here?
- write burnman paper
- write MgSi paper


Todo in far future:
- input Ca/Al
- mass balance calculations

DONE:
x allow for 2nd and 3rd order option in all methods (in such a way that it could be expanded to 4th order in the far future :P )
x allow for the partition coeffecient as an input (maybe an example for this?)
x include ak135
x Convert from cc to SI in seismic files Sanne
x fix benchmark.py
x Make VRH a stand alone function (finished this off, somebody had already written the function, Sanne)
x unify importing of burnman (Timo)
x call it burnman instead of code (Timo/Sanne)
x isothermal/adiabatic bulk modulus
x Timo: geotherm as burnman.geotherm.shankland() (Timo)
x Timo: use phases = [...], instead of phases=(...) (Timo)
x release burnman v0.2 (Timo)
x example_compare_enstpyro.py outputs negative density?! (not true, that is neg. difference)
x write summary for each example as a comment at the top (see example_composition.py) Cayman: Done for the most part
x Clean up plotting (Timo)
x Give 2nd/3rd order approximation option as a different method so we can compare them, Sanne: should we make the method depend on the mineral used? So the method and order used can be in the params? (Cayman) (Created a new method slb3 for the third order stuff)
x slb vs slb_third.py duplicate a lot, avoid that
x consistently order functions that return or accept v_s,v_p,v_phi: order is now v_p, v_s, v_phi (Sanne
x adiabatic geotherm (Ian)
x check attenuation correction and write an example (Sanne, Cayman): attenuation as formulated by Matas is a 0.3% correction (less for P wave velocity). Do we care about this?
