TO DO LIST

======
TO DO DOCUMENT v.3 (Post pre-AGU 2014 Meeting)
======

- Thoroughly document new features / add to manual -- everyone
- Add details of thermodynamic treatment to manual -- Bob/Ian
- Optimize EoS processing to avoid repeated calls to expensive functions -- Timo/Ian
- Split set_state to allow computation of thermoelastic-only and thermodynamic-only (or both) properties -- Ian/Timo
- table.py update, separate html page with all minerals and all solid solutions -- Cayman/Bob
- reference P and T in minerals -- Bob/Ian
- inversion for seismic properties -- Sanne
- Gibbs minimization -- Ian/Timo/Bob
- diagram to show what happens when you incorrectly mix PVT EoSs (2nd/3rd order) -- Sanne
- investigate state of art for solid solution properties (especially volume, bulk modulus, shear modulus) and the effect of using different averaging schemes from endmember properties on seismic velocities in the mantle -- Bob/Ian/Sanne 
- investigate use in high school/university teaching -- Cayman/everyone
- write MgSi paper -- everyone
- write gibbs paper -- everyone


======
TO DO DOCUMENT v.2 (post Texas)
======

X Talk to CIG - do they want us? -- Timo
X Geotherm vs. Brown+Shankland for paper --Ian
X Make brentq more robust --Ian
X Why python? -- Timo
X Make comments up-to-date -- Cayman/everybody 
X Optimize pv example --Sanne
X Geotherm stuff in burnman paper --Ian
X EOS stuff in burnman paper --Ian/Cayman
X Explain 2nd/3rd order stuff in burnman paper --Ian
X Make figures pretty - Timo
X Bibliography -- Sanne/Cayman
X Write section about possibilities for extension/future plans -- Everyone

X clean up composition.py
X document examples (see example_composition.py)
X order examples (figure out dependencies for that), see bottom of readme.txt
X write a manual (what needs to go in here? Nothing but the order of the examples?) Sanne: in the matlab package MSAT, I noticed their manual on the examples was made up out of blocks of text at the top of the examples. I'm not 100% sure yet how they did this. It seems usefull, when we update examples, that the manual changes consistently. 
X write burnman paper


To do list items not required with new thermodynamics/solid solution scheme (December 2014)
- allow for excess stishovite when molecule weight percents are defined
- warn if used eos and mineral eos are different
- input Ca/Al
- mass balance calculations

Still to do (see December 2014 update above)
- write MgSi paper


======
TO DO DOCUMENT v.1
======
X document classes and functions in burnman better, specify units!
X should we split up example_composition.py? Opinions? Timo: yes, try to teach creating of minerals separately. Cayman: I agree. Let's just do this Timo.
X implement option to evaluate K and G (instead of V_s, V_p, V_phi)?
X input different averaging schemes (Voigt and Reuss as separate options, other schemes)
x Change "self_consistent" to adiabat everywhere
x allow for 2nd and 3rd order option in all methods (in such a way that it could be expanded to 4th order in the far future :P )
x allow for the partition coeffecient as an input (maybe an example for this?)
x include ak135
x Convert from cc to SI in seismic files Sanne
x fix benchmark.py
x Make VRH a stand alone function (finished this off, somebody had already written the function, Sanne)
x unify importing of burnman (Timo)
x call it burnman instead of code (Timo/Sanne)
x isothermal/adiabatic bulk modulus
x Timo: geotherm as burnman.geotherm.shankland() (Timo)
x Timo: use phases = [...], instead of phases=(...) (Timo)
x release burnman v0.2 (Timo)
x example_compare_enstpyro.py outputs negative density?! (not true, that is neg. difference)
x write summary for each example as a comment at the top (see example_composition.py) Cayman: Done for the most part
x Clean up plotting (Timo)
x Give 2nd/3rd order approximation option as a different method so we can compare them, Sanne: should we make the method depend on the mineral used? So the method and order used can be in the params? (Cayman) (Created a new method slb3 for the third order stuff)
x slb vs slb_third.py duplicate a lot, avoid that
x consistently order functions that return or accept v_s,v_p,v_phi: order is now v_p, v_s, v_phi (Sanne
x adiabatic geotherm (Ian)
x check attenuation correction and write an example (Sanne, Cayman): attenuation as formulated by Matas is a 0.3% correction (less for P wave velocity). Do we care about this?
