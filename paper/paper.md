# Summary
Many branches of physics, chemistry and Earth sciences conceptually build
complex materials up from simpler constructs: rocks are composites
made up of one or more phases; phases are solutions of more than one endmember
and endmembers are usually mixtures of more than one atom / oxide. The
properties of the endmember building blocks at different pressures and
temperatures can be provided by a wide array of different equations of state.
The averaging of those properties within solutions and composite materials
can also be achieved in several different ways.

# Statement of need
Earth Scientists are interested in a number of different material properties,
including seismic velocities, heat capacities and density as a function of
pressure and temperature. Many of these properties are connected to each
other by physical laws. Building up models of
individual phases to compute these properties and checking them can be time-consuming and prone to error,
and so it is desirable to have well-tested and benchmarked software that
provides convenient functions to calculate the properties of complex
composite materials, and to fit new models.

`BurnMan` is an open source, extensible mineral physics toolbox designed to
calculate the physical properties of natural materials
within the Earth and other planets. The toolbox has a class-based, modular
design that allows users to calculate many low-level properties that
are not accessible using existing codes.

When `BurnMan` was first released [@Cottaar:2014], its focus was on
the seismic properties of the lower mantle, using a single endmember mineral
database [@Stixrude:2011] as a foundation. Since then,
its scope has expanded considerably. Some workflows of the current code
are provided in \autoref{fig:workflows}.

rectangles and classes as diamonds.\label{fig:workflows}](figures/workflows.png)

`BurnMan` now contains equations of state
for minerals and melts from several published datasets. A model for anisotropy
has recently been added. Several solution model formulations are included
(\autoref{fig:garnetsolution}),
and a composite material model that allows several seismic averaging schemes.

model [@Jennings:2015], as output by `BurnMan`.

These material models can be used for many higher levels purposes,
including the fitting of thermodynamic models for both endmembers
and solutions including full error propagation (\autoref{fig:fit}),
construction of self-consistent planetary models
and the calculation of seismic properties. An example of the
planet builder in `BurnMan` is shown in \autoref{fig:zog}.

and moment of inertia factor (0.3307) as Earth. Properties calculated
self-consistently using BurnMan. The computed geotherm is compared to
several from the literature
[@Stacey:1977;@Brown:1981;@Anderson:1982;@Alfe:2007;@Anzellini:2013].
\label{fig:zog}](figures/zog.png)

Utility classes and functions are also provided to undertake bulk and 
phase chemical calculations, to aid preparation and analysis of experiments.

`BurnMan` does not attempt to replicate Gibbs minimization codes,
of which there are many (PerpleX, HeFESTo, TheriakDomino, FactSAGE and MageMin).
Instead, it provides two methods to deal with the problem of
thermodynamic equilibrium: (1) reading in a P-T table of precalculated
properties into a Material class, and (2) a function (`burnman.equilibrate`)
that chemically equilibrates a known assemblage under constraints
(two or three choices from fixed pressure, temperature, entropy, volume,
phase proportions and compositions).
An example is shown in Figure \autoref{fig:eqm}.
The equilibrate function is similar to that implemented in ThermoCalc
[@Holland:1998].

The features used in `BurnMan` are documented in the codebase
(\url{https://github.com/geodynamics/burnman}), and in the
manual (\url{https://burnman.readthedocs.io}). A Jupyter notebook tutorial
(available at \url{https://geodynamics.github.io/burnman/#download})
introduces some of the core functionality, and more features are investigated
in the extensive set of examples.

# Past and ongoing research projects
In addition to lower mantle studies [@Cottaar:2014b;@Jenkins:2017],
`BurnMan` has been used to investigate Earth's core [@Irving:2018],
in phase equilibria studies [@Myhill:2017;@Ishii:2019], to develop new models
for anisotropic thermodynamics [@Myhill:2022], to constrain the interiors
of exoplanets [@Unterborn:2016], and to provide input for geodynamic simulations
[@Heister:2017;@Dannberg:2021].
