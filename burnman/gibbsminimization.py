def assemble_stoichiometric_matrix ( minerals):

    This takes a list of minerals and assembles a matrix where 
    the rows are elements and the columns are species (or endmembers).
    If a solid solution is passed in, then the endmembers are extracted

    ----------
    minerals : list of minerals
        List of objects of type :class:`burnman.Mineral` or `burnman.SolidSolution`.

    Returns
    -------
    stoichiometric_matrix: 2D numpy array 
        2D numpy array that is n_elements by n_endmembers.  The matrix entries
        are the number of atoms of an element in that particular endmember.
        The elements are ordered alphabetically, and the endmembers are ordered
        in the order in which they are passed in.
    elements: list of strings
        List of elements that are in the stoichiometric matrix, in alphabetical
        order.
    formulae: list of strings
        List of endmember formulae constructed from the minerals passed in.
        They are ordered in the same order as they are passed in, but with 
        The endmembers in the solid solutions also included.

    The vectors computed using :func:`compute_nullspace` are non-unique, and are
    not likely to correspond to the most physically meaningful set of reactions.  
    Instead we would often like to know a set of nullspace vectors that are the 
    "sparsest", meaning that they involve a minimal set of reactions.  This is known
    to be an NP-hard problem.  This function makes a fairly crude attempt to 
    take a set of vectors and rotate them to the sparsest coordinate system. It does 
    this by doing many L1 minimizations of the vectors, and as such might be 
    pretty slow, especially for large sets of bases.
