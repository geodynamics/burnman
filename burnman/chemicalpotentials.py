# This module computes chemical potentials (partial molar gibbs free energies) for an assemblage based on the Gibbs free energies and compositions of the individual phases.

# It can also calculate fugacities based on the gibbs free energies of the endmembers corresponding to chemical components.

# It can also calculate fugacities relative to other bulk compositions
