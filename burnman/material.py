    Base class for all materials. The main functionality is unroll() which
    returns a list of objects of type :class:`~burnman.mineral.Mineral` and their molar
    fractions. This class is available as ``burnman.Material``.

    The user needs to call set_method() (once in the beginning) and set_state()
    before querying the material with unroll() or density().

    ----------
    pressure : float
        The current pressure as set by :func:`~burnman.Material.set_state`. [Pa]
    temperature : float
        The current temperature as set by :func:`~burnman.Material.set_state`. [K]
