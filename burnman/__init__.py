"""BurnMan
=======

BurnMan is an open source mineral physics toolbox written in Python which
determines seismic velocities for the lower mantle. BurnMan calculates the
isotropic thermoelastic moduli by solving the equations-of-state for a
mixture of minerals defined by the user. The user may select from a list of
minerals applicable to the lower mantle included or easily define one of
their own.

Features:

  - form composites of arbitrary combination of :doc:`minerals`
  - extensive :doc:`mineral_database`
  - easy plotting and comparison of seismic profiles using matplotlib
  - many examples highlighting different features of BurnMan
  - different thermoelastic models, choice between second or third order accuracy
  - different averaging schemes
  - different geotherms
  - extensible: all parts can be replaced by user-written modules if desired
