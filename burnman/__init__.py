Introducing BurnMan
===================

Overview
--------

BurnMan is an open source mineral physics and seismological toolkit written in Python
which can enable a user to calculate (or fit) the physical and chemical properties
of endmember minerals, fluids/melts, solid solutions, and composite assemblages. 

Properties which BurnMan can calculate include:

  - the thermodynamic free energies, allowing phase equilibrium calculations,
    endmember activities, chemical potentials and oxygen (and other) fugacities.

  - entropy, enabling the user to calculate isentropes for a given assemblage.

  - volume, to allow the user to create density profiles.

  - seismic velocities, including Voigt-Reuss-Hill and Hashin-Strikman bounds
    and averages.

The toolkit itself comes with a large set of classes and functions which are 
designed to allow the user to easily combine mineral physics with 
geophysics, and geodynamics. The features of BurnMan include:
 
  - the full codebase, which includes implementations of many static and thermal equations of state 
    (including Vinet, Birch Murnaghan, Mie-Debye-Grueneisen, Modified Tait), 
    and solution models (ideal, symmetric, asymmetric, subregular).
  - popular endmember and solution datasets already coded into burnman-usable format 
    (including :cite:`HP2011`, :cite:`Stixrude2005` and :cite:`Stixrude2011`)
  - Optimal least squares fitting routines for multivariate data with (potentially correlated) errors 
    in pressure and temperature. As an example, such functions can be used to 
    simultaneously fit volumes, seismic velocities and enthalpies. 
  - a "Planet" class, which self-consistently calculates gravity profiles, mass, moment of 
    inertia of planets given the chemical and temperature structure of a planet
  - published geotherms
  - a tutorial on the basic use of BurnMan
  - a large collection of annotated examples
  - a set of high-level functions which create files readable by seismological and geodynamic software, 
    including: Mineos :cite:`Masters2011`, AxiSEM :cite:`NissenMeyer2014` and ASPECT
  - an extensive suite of unit tests to ensure code functions as intended
  - a series of benchmarks comparing BurnMan output with published data
  - a directory containing user-contributed code from published papers

BurnMan makes extensive use of `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ and 
`NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_, which are widely used Python libraries 
for scientific computation.  `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ is used 
to display results and produce publication quality figures.  
The computations are consistently formulated in terms of SI units.

The code documentation including class and function descriptions can be found online at
http://burnman.readthedocs.io. 

This software has been designed to allow the end-user a great deal of freedom
to do whatever calculations they may wish and to add their own modules. 
The underlying Python classes have been designed to make new endmember, 
solid solution and composite models easy to read and create.
We have endeavoured to provide examples and benchmarks which cover the 
most popular uses of the software, some of which are included in the figure below. 
This list is certainly not exhaustive, and we will definitely have missed interesting
applications. We will be very happy to accept contributions in
form of corrections, examples, or new features.
