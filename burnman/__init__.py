BurnMan
=======

BurnMan is an open source mineral physics toolbox written in Python which
determines the velocities of seismic waves in mineral assemblages at 
high pressure and temperature. It was designed to calculate seismic 
velocities in the lower mantle, but is equally suited to any part 
of the solid Earth (or indeed any of the terrestrial planets). 
BurnMan calculates the isotropic thermoelastic moduli by solving the 
equations-of-state for a mixture of minerals defined by the user. The user 
may select from an extensive list of minerals obtained from published 
databases. Alternatively, they can easily define their own minerals.

Features:

  - a range of thermoelastic models, choice between second or third order accuracy
  - a range of thermodynamic models for mineral endmembers
  - consistent, comprehensive treatment of minerals with solid solutions
  - form composites of arbitrary combination of :doc:`materials`
  - extensive :doc:`mineral_database`
  - easy plotting and comparison of seismic profiles using matplotlib
  - many examples highlighting different features of BurnMan
  - different averaging schemes for seismic velocities in composite materials
  - a catalogue of published geotherms
  - extensible: all parts can be replaced by user-written modules if desired
