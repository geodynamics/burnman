This is made more secure by two recent developments, an experimental study of the FeS eutectic to 100 kbar by Usselman and a calculation by Bukowinski which reveals an electronic phase collapse of potassium in the 200–300 kbar range and explains the core heat source. Use is made of the Vashchenko-Zubarev formulation of the Grüneisen ratio, and Lindemann's melting law, both of which have been shown recently to have particular relevance at very high pressures. Values of electronic specific heat and the Grüneisen ratio, which contribute significantly to core properties are calculated from the electron equation of state of Zharkov and Kalinin.}

  abstract = {The current methods of performing CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) calculations of high-pressure phase equilibria often lead to spurious predictions of negative thermal expansion or negative heat capacity at high pressures. It is shown that the origin of the problem lies in an incompatibility between the temperature dependence of the widely used SGTE (Scientific Group Thermodata Europe) database and that of typical equations of state of the Mie–Grüneisen type. This inconsistency is also linked to the general problem of describing mechanical instability in CALPHAD. In the present work, a new free energy formulation is developed specifically for inclusion of pressure effects in CALPHAD methodology. It is based on an interpolation between SGTE data at low pressures and the quasiharmonic lattice model at high pressures. The new formulation is constrained to physically credible predictions of the thermophysical properties, while preserving the simplicity of the CALPHAD method. Examples are given of calculations of thermophysical properties and high-pressure phase equilibria in Al, Si, MgO, Fe and the Al–Si binary alloy system.}

  abstract = {Earth's core is believed to consist of a solid inner core and an outer liquid core. Since the inner core is mostly solid iron, most geophysical work has focused on melting of pure iron at core conditions. The inner core density is well matched with seismological data if some S is added to iron. The available phase equilibrium experimental data in the binary Fe–S system to pressures as high as ~200GPa is used to create a thermodynamic database extending to core pressures that can be used to calculate the inner core density if S were the only other constituent. Such a calculation gives the maximum temperature of the solid inner core as 4428 (±500)K (363.85GPa, density=13.09g/cm3) with a sulfur content of ~15wt%. To be consistent with the seismically determined density, the outer liquid core requires mixing of yet another light element or elements; both oxygen and carbon are suitable.}

Spin states of iron in lower-mantle ferropericlase have been measured up to 95 gigapascals and 2000 kelvin with x-ray emission in a laser-heated diamond cell. A gradual spin transition of iron occurs over a pressure-temperature range extending from about 1000 kilometers in depth and 1900 kelvin to 2200 kilometers and 2300 kelvin in the lower mantle. Because low-spin ferropericlase exhibits higher density and faster sound velocities relative to the high-spin ferropericlase, the observed increase in low-spin (Mg,Fe)O at mid-lower mantle conditions would manifest seismically as a lower-mantle spin transition zone characterized by a steeper-than-normal density gradient.},
