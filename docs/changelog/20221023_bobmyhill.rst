* Four new property modifier formulations are provided, 
  which can be specified with the names "debye", "debye_delta", 
  "einstein" and "einstein_delta". These 
  are based on the Debye and Einstein models of thermal energy.
  The heat capacity ("debye", "einstein")
  or entropy ("debye_delta", "einstein_delta")
  are based on the heat capacity of the respective thermal model,
  and so reach a maximum at high temperature. The
  excess energy, entropy and heat capacity are all zero
  at 0 K. The excess volume is always zero.
