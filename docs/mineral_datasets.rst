Mineral Datasets
================

BurnMan includes a large collection of mineral datasets in
the the :mod:`burnman.minerals` module that
provide thermodynamic and thermoelastic properties
for minerals commonly found in the Earth and planetary interiors.

See :ref:`ref-api-mineral-database` for a list of built-in
