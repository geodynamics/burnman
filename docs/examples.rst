Examples
********

BurnMan comes with a large collection of example programs under examples/.

In this documentation section we include many of these examples.
They are grouped here into three categories: :ref:`ref-example-class`,
:ref:`ref-example-simple` and :ref:`ref-example-advanced`.
The :ref:`ref-example-class` introduce the main class types in BurnMan,
and covers similar ground to :ref:`ref-example-tutorial` but in a little more
detail. :ref:`ref-example-simple` provides introductions to some of the seismic
and chemical functions. :ref:`ref-example-advanced` covers functionality
which is more suited to research projects.

Finally, we also include the scripts that were used for all computations and
figures in the 2014 BurnMan paper in the misc/ folder, see
:ref:`ref-example-paper`.
