Averaging schemes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


After the thermoelastic parameters (:math:`K_S`, :math:`G`, :math:`\rho`) of each phase are determined at each pressure and/or
temperature step, these values must be combined to determine the seismic velocity of a multiphase assemblage.
We define the volume fraction of the individual minerals in an assemblage:

.. math::
    \nu_i = n_i \frac{V_i}{V},

where :math:`V_i` and :math:`n_i` are the molar volume and the molar fractions of the :math:`i` th individual phase, and :math:`V` is the total molar volume of the assemblage:



.. math::
    V = \sum_i n_i  V_i.
    :label: composite_volume


The density of the multiphase assemblage is then


.. math::
    \rho = \sum_i \nu_i \rho_i = \frac{1}{V}\sum_i {n_i \mu_i},
    :label: composite_density

where :math:`\rho_i` is the density and :math:`\mu_i` is the molar mass of the :math:`i` th phase.


Unlike density and volume, there is no straightforward way to average the bulk and shear moduli of a multiphase rock, as it depends on the specific distribution and orientation of the constituent minerals.
BurnMan allows several schemes for averaging the elastic moduli: the Voigt and Reuss bounds, the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds, the Voigt-Reuss-Hill average, and the Hashin-Shtrikman average :cite:`Watt1976`.


The Voigt average, assuming constant strain across all phases, is defined as

.. math::
    X_V = \sum_i \nu_i X_i,
    :label: voigt

where :math:`X_i` is the bulk or shear modulus for the :math:`i` th phase.
The Reuss average, assuming constant stress across all phases, is defined as

.. math::
    X_R = \left(\sum_i \frac{\nu_i}{X_i} \right)^{-1}.
    :label: reuss

The Voigt-Reuss-Hill average is the arithmetic mean of Voigt and Reuss bounds:

.. math::
    X_{VRH} = \frac{1}{2} \left( X_V + X_R \right).
    :label: vrh

The Hashin-Shtrikman bounds make an additional assumption that the distribution of the phases is statistically isotropic and are usually much narrower than the Voigt and Reuss bounds :cite:`Watt1976`.
This may be a poor assumption in regions of Earth with high anisotropy, such as the lowermost mantle, however these bounds are more physically motivated than the commonly-used Voigt-Reuss-Hill average.
In most instances, the Voigt-Reuss-Hill average and the arithmetic mean of the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds are quite similar with the pure arithmetic mean (linear averaging) being well outside of both.

It is worth noting that each of the above bounding methods are derived from mechanical models of a linear elastic composite.
It is thus only appropriate to apply them to elastic moduli, and not to other thermoelastic properties, such as wave speeds or density.



Computing seismic velocities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the moduli for the multiphase assemblage are computed, the compressional (:math:`P`), shear (:math:`S`) and bulk sound (:math:`\Phi`)
velocities are then result from the equations:


.. math::
    V_P = \sqrt{ \frac{K_S + \frac{4}{3} G} {\rho} }, \qquad
    V_S = \sqrt{ \frac{G}{\rho} }, \qquad
    V_\Phi = \sqrt{ \frac{K_S}{\rho} }.
    :label: seismic

To correctly compare to observed seismic velocities one needs to correct for the frequency sensitivity of attenuation.
Moduli parameters are obtained from experiments that are done at high frequencies (MHz-GHz) compared to seismic frequencies (mHz-Hz).
The frequency sensitivity of attenuation causes slightly lower velocities for seismic waves than they would be for high frequency waves.
In BurnMan one can correct the calculated acoustic velocity values to those for long period seismic tomography :cite:`Minster1981`:

.. math::
    V_{S/P}=V_{S/P}^{\mathrm{uncorr.}}\left(1-\frac{1}{2}\cot(\frac{\beta\pi}{2})\frac{1}{Q_{S/P}}(\omega)\right).

Similar to :cite:`Matas2007`, we use a :math:`\beta` value of 0.3, which falls in the range of values of :math:`0.2` to :math:`0.4` proposed for the lower mantle (e.g. :cite:`Karato1990`).
The correction is implemented for :math:`Q` values of PREM for the lower mantle.
As :math:`Q_S` is smaller than :math:`Q_P`, the correction is more significant for S waves.
In both cases, though, the correction is minor compared to, for example, uncertainties in the temperature (corrections) and mineral physical parameters.
More involved models of relaxation mechanisms can be implemented, but lead to the inclusion of more poorly constrained parameters, :cite:`Matas2007a`.
While attenuation can be ignored in many applications :cite:`Trampert2001`, it might play a significant role in explaining strong variations in seismic velocities in the lowermost mantle :cite:`Davies2012`.
