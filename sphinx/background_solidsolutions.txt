Calculating Solid Solution Properties
-------------------------------------
Many minerals can exist over a finite region of composition space. These spaces are bounded by endmembers (which may themselves not be stable), and each individual mineral can then be described as a solid solution of those endmembers. At an atomic level, different elements substitute for one another on distinct crystallographic sites in the structure. For example, low pressure silicate garnets have two distinct sites on which mixing takes place; a dodecahedral site (of which there are three per unit cell on an eight-cation basis) and octahedral site (of which there are two per unit cell). A third tetrahedral cation site (three per unit cell) is usually assumed to be occupied solely by silicon, and therefore can be ignored in solid solution calculations. The chemical formula of many low pressure garnets exist within the solid solution:

.. math::
    \textrm{[Mg,Fe,Mn,Ca]}_3\textrm{[Al,Fe,Cr]}_2\textrm{Si}_3\textrm{O}_{12}


We typically calculate solid solution properties by appropriate differentiation of the Gibbs Free energy, where

.. math::
    \mathcal{G} = \sum_i n_i \left( \mathcal{G}_i + RT \ln \alpha_i \right)\\
    \alpha_i = \gamma_i \alpha_{\textrm{ideal}, i}
    
Implemented models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ideal solid solutions
"""""""""""""""""""""
A solid solution is not simply a mechanical mixture of its constituent endmembers. The mixing of different elements on sites results in an excess configurational entropy

.. math::	
    \mathcal{S}_{\textrm{conf}} = R \ln \prod_s (X_c^s)^{\nu}


where :math:`s` is a site in the lattice :math:`M`, :math:`c` are the cations mixing on site :math:`s` and :math:`\nu` is the number of :math:`s` sites in the formula unit. Solid solutions where this configurational entropy is the only deviation from a mechanical mixture are termed *ideal*. From this expression, we can see that

.. math::	
    \alpha_{\textrm{ideal}, i} = \prod_s (X_c^s)^{\nu}

Symmetric solid solutions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
Many real minerals are not well approximated as ideal solid solutions. Deviations are the result of elastic and chemical interactions between ions with different physical and chemical characteristics. Regular (symmetric) solid solution models are designed to account for the simplest form of deviations from ideality, by allowing the addition of excess enthalpies, non-configurational entropies and volumes to the ideal solution model. These excess terms have the matrix form :cite:`DPWH2007`

.. math::
    \mathcal{G}_{\textrm{excess}} = RT \ln \gamma = p^T W p

where :math:`p` is a vector of molar fractions of each of the :math:`n` endmembers and :math:`W` is a strictly upper-triangular matrix of interaction terms between endmembers. Excesses within binary systems (:math:`i`-:math:`j`) have a quadratic form and a maximum of :math:`W_{ij}/4` half-way between the two endmembers.

Asymmetric solid solutions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Some solid solutions exhibit asymmetric excess terms. These can be accounted for with an asymmetric solid solution :cite:`DPWH2007`

.. math::
    \mathcal{G}_{\textrm{excess}} = \alpha^T p (\phi^T W \phi)

:math:`\alpha` is a vector of "van  Laar parameters" governing asymmetry in the excess properties. 


.. math::
    \phi_i &= \frac{\alpha_i p_i}{\sum_{k=1}^{n} \alpha_k p_k}, \\
    W_{ij} &= \frac{2 w_{ij}}{\alpha_i + \alpha_j} \textrm{for i<j}

The :math:`w_{ij}` terms are a set of interaction terms between endmembers :math:`i` and :math:`j`. If all the :math:`\alpha` terms are equal to unity, a non-zero :math:`w` yields an excess with a quadratic form and a maximum of :math:`w/4` half-way between the two endmembers. 


Subregular solid solutions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
An alternative way to create asymmetric solution models is to expand each binary term as a cubic expression :cite:`HW1989`. In this case,

.. math::
    \mathcal{G}_{\textrm{excess}} = \sum_i p_i p_j^2 W_{ij} + p_j p_i^2 W_{ji}

Note the similarity with the symmetric solution model, the primary difference being that there are not two interaction terms for each binary.



Thermodynamic and thermoelastic properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
From the preceeding equations, we can define the thermodynamic potentials of solid solutions:
 
.. math::
    \mathcal{G}_{\textrm{SS}} &= \sum_i n_i \left( \mathcal{G}_i + RT \ln \alpha_i \right)\\
    \mathcal{S}_{\textrm{SS}} &= \sum_in_i\mathcal{S}_i + \mathcal{S}_{\textrm{conf}} - \frac{\partial \mathcal{G}_{\textrm{excess}}}{\partial T} \\	
    \mathcal{H}_{\textrm{SS}} &= \mathcal{G}_{\textrm{SS}} + T\mathcal{S}_{\textrm{SS}}\\
    V_{\textrm{SS}} &= \sum_in_iV_i + \frac{\partial \mathcal{G}_{\textrm{excess}}}{\partial P}

We can also define the derivatives of volume with respect to pressure and temperature

.. math::
    \alpha_{P,\textrm{SS}} &= \frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P = \left( \frac{1}{V_{\textrm{SS}}}\right)\left( \sum_i\left(n_i\,\alpha_i\,V_i \right) \right) \\
    K_{T,\textrm{SS}} &= V\left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial V} \right)_T = V_{\textrm{SS}} \left( \frac{1}{\sum_i\left(n_i \frac{V_{i}}{K_{Ti}} \right)} + \frac{\partial P}{\partial V_{\textrm{excess}}} \right) 

Making the approximation that the excess entropy has no temperature dependence

.. math::
    C_{P,\textrm{SS}} &= \sum_in_iC_{Pi}\\
    C_{V, \textrm{SS}} &= C_{P,\textrm{SS}} - V_{\textrm{SS}}\,T\,\alpha_{\textrm{SS}}^{2}\,K_{T,\textrm{SS}} \\
    K_{S,\textrm{SS}} &= K_{T,\textrm{SS}} \,\frac{C_{P,\textrm{SS}}}{C_{V,\textrm{SS}}}\\
    \gamma_{\textrm{SS}} &= \frac{\alpha_{\textrm{SS}}\,K_{T,\textrm{SS}}\,V_{\textrm{SS}}}{C_{V, \textrm{SS}}}
    

Including order-disorder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Order-disorder can be treated trivially with solid solutions. The only difference between mixing between ordered and disordered endmembers is that disordered endmembers have a non-zero configurational entropy, which must be accounted for when calculating the excess entropy within a solid solution.  

Including spin transitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The regular solid solution formalism should provide an elegant way to model spin transitions in phases such as periclase and bridgmanite. High and low spin iron can be treated as different elements, providing distinct endmembers and an excess configurational entropy. Further excess terms can be added as necessary.
