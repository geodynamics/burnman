One common example is when we want to approximate the properties of an ordered phase relative to its disordered counterparts. In many cases, a reasonable procedure is to make a mechanical mixture of the known phases, such that they are the correct composition of the unknown phase, and then apply a linear correction to the Gibbs energy of the phase (i.e. $\\Delta \\mathcal{G} = \\Delta \\mathcal{E} - T \\Delta S + P \\Delta V$). In BurnMan, we do this using the CombinedMineral class. In the lines below, we create an ordered orthopyroxene with composition MgFeSi$_2$O$_6$ from a 50:50 mixture of enstatite and ferrosilite. We make this compound 6 kJ/mol more stable than the mechanical mixture."

These models are therefore unable to accurately account for local interactions that give rise to **short-range order**, but Bragg-Williams models with multiple sites *can* provide a first-order approximation to the energetic effects of **long-range order**. From a microscopic standpoint, the distinction is an artificial one, since long-range order arises from local interactions (e.g. Bethe 1934, 1935). However, a detailed treatment of order-disorder requires either complex models (Kikuchi, 1951) or ab-initio simulations that have their own dedicated software packages (e.g. VASP).\n"
