CIDER 2014 BurnMan Tutorial --- step 3
--------------------------------------

In the previous two steps of the tutorial we tried to find a very simple 
mineralogical model that best fit the 1D seismic model PREM.  But we 
know that there is consideral uncertainty in many of the mineral
physical parameters that control how the elastic properties of minerals 
change with pressure and temperature.  In this step we explore how uncertainties
in these parameters might affect the conclusions you draw.

The strategy here is to make many different "realizations" of the rock 
that you determined was the closest fit to PREM, where each realization 
has its mineral physical parameters perturbed by a small amount, hopefully 
related to the uncertainty in that parameter.  In particular, we will
look at how perturbations to :math:`K_{0}^{'}` and :math:`G_{0}^{'}` (the pressure derivatives of the 
bulk and shear modulus, respectively) change the calculated 1D seismic
profiles.

This script may be run by typing

    the velocity/density space.  The dashed lines show the PREM values.  Tighter
    histograms indicate that the perturbations to the mineral physical values 
    make less of a difference, more spread out ones show larger effects.
