CIDER 2014 BurnMan Tutorial --- step 1
--------------------------------------

In this first part of the tutorial we will acquaint ourselves with a basic
script for calculating the elastic properties of a mantle mineralogical
model.  

In general, there are three portions of this script:

1) Define a set of pressures and temperatures at which we want to 
calculate elastic properties

2) Setup a composite of minerals (or "rock") and calculate its 
elastic properties at those pressures and temperatures.

3) Plot those elastic properties, and compare them to a seismic
model, in this case PREM


The script is basically already written, and should run as is by typing:

    python step_1.py

on the command line.  However, the mineral model for the rock is not
very realistic, and you will want to change it to one that is more 
in accordance with what we think the bulk composition of Earth's lower mantle is.

    Part (1) --- Defining the pressures and temperatures.
    We get the pressures from the PREM density model for a list of
    depths in Earth, and a model for the temperature profile with
    depth from Brown and Shankland (1981).  In addition, we get the
    density and elastic properties from PREM, which we will use later
    for comparison purposes

    """
    Part (2) -- Defining the rock

    The object burnman.Composite expects two lists, one with the molar
    fractions of the different minerals making up the rock, and one with 
    the minerals themselves. 

    Here we setup a rock made from stishovite (SiO_2) and wustite (FeO), which is 
    probably not the most realistic mineralogical model for Earth's lower
    mantle. This is the place where you will want to make changes.

    For our simplified mantle model, consider a three element model, with 
    Mg, Si, and O.  This will make a mantle with magnesium perovskite (MgSiO_3)
    and periclase (MgO). We can replace minerals.SLB_2011.stishovite() and 
    minerals.SLB_2011.wuestite() with minerals.SLB_2011.mg_perovskite()
    and minerals.SLB_2011.periclase() and play with the relative fraction 
    of the two phases.

    # sets the state of the rock at each of the pressures and temperatures defined,

    # it performs elastic averaging on the phases to get a single bulk and shear
    # modulus for the rock.  This averaging scheme defaults to Voigt-Reuss-Hilli,
    # but see example_averaging.py for other options.  Finally, it calculates the seismic
    # wave speeds for the whole rock.  It returns a tuple of density, p-wave velocity
    # s-wave velocity, bulk sound speed, bulk modulus, and shear modulus.

    """
    Part (3) --- Plotting and comparison

    This should not need to be changed, though of course you may if you like.  It plots the 
    resulting densities, shear wave speeds and bulk sound speeds against pressure, as 
    well as plotting the relevant values from PREM for comparison.  

    You can try modifying the phase_1_fraction above to try to get a closer fit, or
    a more complicated mineralogical model.

    You will probably have a hard time getting a close match with our simple model.  
    In particular, the densities will be too low and the wave speeds will be too fast.
    This is likely due to the fact that we have not included iron, which will make the
    rocks denser, which will in turn slow down the wave speeds.
