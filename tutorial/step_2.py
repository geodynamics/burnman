CIDER 2014 BurnMan Tutorial --- step 2
--------------------------------------

In this second part of the tutorial we try to get a closer fit to our
1D seismic reference model.  In the simple Mg, Si, and O model that 
we used in step 1 there was one free parameter, namely phase_1_fraction,
which goes between zero and one.  

In this script we want to explore how good of a fit to PREM we can get 
by varying this fraction. We create a simple function that calculates 
a misfit between PREM and our mineral model as a function of phase_1_fraction,
and then plot this misfit function to try to find a best model.

This script may be run by typing
    
    python step_2.py

    This is the main workhorse of this script.  We define the function ``misfit''
    which takes a single parameter phase_1_fraction.  We create the rock we want,
    calculate its elastic properties, and then calculate an L2 misfit between 
    the calculated profiles for Vs, Vphi, and density and those for PREM.

    Here again is our model with stishovite and wuestite.  Instead of that, you
    will want to copy the ``rock'' you created in step 1.  If you experimented with
    other rocks than those with Mg perovskite and periclase, you can also try those.
