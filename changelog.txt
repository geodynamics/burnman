Release v1.2.0 (July 1, 2023) includes
  - Two new helper functions:
    :func:`burnman.tools.chemistry.reactions_from_stoichiometric_matrix`
    :func:`burnman.tools.chemistry.reactions_from_formulae`.
    These functions generate a complete list of reactions
    (forward and reverse) from either the stoichiometric matrix
    (a 2D numpy array containing the amount of component j in phase i),
    or from a list of formulae
    (as strings or dictionaries of elemental amounts).
  - Solution and ElasticSolution objects are now instantiated
    with a SolutionModel object as a solution_model parameter.
    The use of the solution_type parameter has been removed
    completely, along with all of the optional parameters that were
    originally passed as parameters to SolutionModel.
  - A generalised PolynomialSolution class. The
    non-ideal excesses in this model are polynomial functions
    of composition. This class can deal with arbitrarily high powers in endmember
    proportions. However, because the class internally converts the
    list of lists to numpy arrays, high powers of solutions with a
    large number of endmembers will create very large
    arrays (with order n_endmembers^(highest power) elements).
    This may significantly slow down calculations.
  - Five new property modifier formulations,
    which can be specified with the names "debye", "debye_delta",
    "einstein", "einstein_delta" and "landau_slb_2022". These
    are based on the Debye and Einstein models of thermal energy
    and the Landau model of Stixrude and Lithgow-Bertelloni (2022).
    The heat capacity ("debye", "einstein")
    or entropy ("debye_delta", "einstein_delta")
    are based on the heat capacity of the respective thermal model,
    and reach a maximum at high temperature. The
    excess energy, entropy and heat capacity of these four modifiers
    are all zero at 0 K, and the excess volume is always zero.
  - An implementation of the SLB2022 dataset.
  - This version is associated with acceptance of the JOSS paper.

Release v1.1.0 (September 14, 2022)
  - the equilibrate function now solves problems where the bulk composition is allowed to vary
  - the solution model formulation has been updated to allow site multiplicities to vary linearly with endmember proportions (as in a Temkin model)
  - a new BoundaryLayerPerturbation class has been implemented to enable thermal perturbations to be added to planetary layers
  - a new equation of state, BroshCalphad has been implemented, following Brosh et al. (2007)
  - the Composite class now has a chemical_potential method
  - a new Calibrant class, that enables users to calculate pressure/volume as a function of volume/pressure and temperature, also allowing propagation of uncertainties
  - a new eos fitting function, fit_XPTp_data, that enables fitting of solution model parameters to experimental data
  - Material classes now have a method called set_state_with_volume
  - a new ElasticSolution class that defines excess solution properties as a function of the volume and temperature of the endmembers, rather than pressure and temperature
  - excess properties of solution models can now be defined using a function, rather than by hardwired functional forms
